1. Define Requirements & Features
   Before jumping into development, clarify the features you want to implement:
   1.User Roles: Admin (create exams, manage questions), Teacher (create/edit exams, review results), Student (take exams, view results).
   2.Exam Management: Ability to create exams, manage questions, define time limits.
   3.Question Types: Multiple-choice, true/false, short-answer, etc.
   4.Real-time Result Calculation: Automatically grade after exam submission.
   5.Timer: Display a countdown during exams.
   6.Authentication & Authorization: Secure login system (JWT, session-based).
   7.Responsive UI: For ease of use across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
   8.Data Security: Protect exam questions, answers, and user data.
   9.Logging & Monitoring: Track system usage and errors.

2. Tech Stack
   1.Backend: Node.js with Express.
   2.Database: MongoDB (for flexibility) or PostgreSQL (if relational data and advanced queries are needed).
   3.Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or Passport.js.
   4.Frontend: React.js or Angular for a dynamic, single-page application.
   5.Deployment: Docker containers for easy deployment, Heroku or AWS for hosting.
   Testing: Mocha/Chai for unit testing.

4. Database Design
   Here is an example of how your database schema could look (for MongoDB or PostgreSQL):

   Users Table (Users can be Admin, Teacher, or Student):
   id, email, password, role (enum: Admin, Teacher, Student), createdAt, updatedAt

   Exams Table:
   id, title, description, duration, createdBy (FK to Users), createdAt, updatedAt

   Questions Table:
   id, questionText, questionType (MCQ, True/False, etc.), choices (for MCQs), correctAnswer, examId (FK to Exams), createdAt

   Exam Results Table:
   id, examId (FK to Exams), studentId (FK to Users), answers (JSON object with selected answers), score, createdAt

5. Endpoints and Routes Design
   Here are some of the main RESTful routes you can implement:

Authentication:

    POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user (Admin/Teacher/Student)
    POST /api/auth/login: Login for access token (JWT)
    POST /api/auth/logout: Logout (invalidate token)
    User Management (Admin only):

    GET /api/users: List all users
    GET /api/users/:id: Get a specific user
    PUT /api/users/:id: Update user details
    DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user
    Exam Management (Teacher/Admin):

    GET /api/exams: List all exams
    POST /api/exams: Create a new exam
    PUT /api/exams/:id: Edit an exam
    DELETE /api/exams/:id: Delete an exam
    Question Management (Teacher/Admin):

    POST /api/exams/:examId/questions: Add questions to an exam
    PUT /api/questions/:id: Update question
    DELETE /api/questions/:id: Delete a question
    Student Exam Taking:

    GET /api/exams/:id: Get exam details (for students)
    POST /api/exams/:id/submit: Submit exam answers
    Results:

    GET /api/results/:examId: View exam results for a student (or as an admin)
